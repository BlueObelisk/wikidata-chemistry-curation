# Wikidata-based curation approaches

## Polymers without CXSMILES

Many polymers can have a CXSMILES property and the following query lists those that do not
have this property:

<sparql>polymersWithoutCXSMILES</sparql>

This returns values like this:

<out limit="5">polymersWithoutCXSMILES</out>

## Functional groups without CXSMILES

We can do the same thing for functional groups:

<sparql>functionalGroupsWithoutCXSMILES</sparql>

Here too, the list provides a list of curation opportunities:

<out limit="5">functionalGroupsWithoutCXSMILES</out>
