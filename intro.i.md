# Introduction

[Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) is a useful resource in the linked data network [<cite>Q27042516</cite>].
It has knowledge about more than 1.3 million chemical compounds, exceeding the number of compounds in Wikipedia.
Because every Wikipedia article has a matching Wikidata record, Wikipedia should be a subset. Several efforts
have taken place to add chemistry to Wikdiata and some of that has been published.
For example, Waagmeester, Stupp, Burgstaller-Muehlbacher, and others wrote a bot to add relevant life science
knowledge to Wikidata, including small compounds [<cite>Q87830400</cite>]. Rutz and others use Wikidata for
natural products [<cite>Q112143478</cite>], and Willighagen and others recently wrote up an extension of
Scholia for Chemistry [<cite>Q134520857</cite>].

The last raises the question how the quality control of the chemistry in Wikidata is handled. This ebook
aims to explain the methods we have at hand to do just that. It consists of several chapters explaining
the intrinsic property contraints, useful SPARQL queries, and cheminformatics-based scripts that detect
inconsistencies.
